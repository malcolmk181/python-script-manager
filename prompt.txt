I want to create a Python script that meets this short description:

"""
{short_description}
"""

I have a program that automates creating the Python environment, installing dependencies, and running the script, so do not include any installation or execution steps in your response.

Additionally, the program allows me to easily edit the script and requirements.txt file, and it can rebuild the environment automatically if changes are made. With this in mind:

I need:
	1.	A specific Python version number (e.g., 3.11) that is compatible with the libraries and task.
	2.	A requirements.txt file listing only the libraries necessary for the script. Feel free to include all dependencies even if only some might be used, as I can easily adjust it later.
	3.	A Python script written in a clear and beginner-friendly way, formatted in the following structure:

```
from dotenv import load_dotenv  # Import load_dotenv if using a .env file

def main():
    # If a .env file is needed for secrets, uncomment the line below to load environment variables
    # load_dotenv()

    # perform functionality

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The script should include comments explaining the logic step-by-step.

If the script requires any secrets or environment variables (e.g., API keys), explicitly explain:
- Where and how to retrieve the necessary API key or secret.
- How to structure and add the API key or secret to the .env file (e.g., the exact variable name and format to use).

Make sure the explanation is clear and beginner-friendly. Provide enough detail to ensure that someone unfamiliar with these concepts can still follow the instructions successfully.

Here's a detailed description of how I want the script to perform:

"""
{detailed_description}
"""

Make sure the response is friendly, helpful, and clear, as I may need to debug or make small changes. Since I can easily edit the requirements.txt file and script, feel free to make assumptions if something isn't perfectly defined. However, focus on ensuring that the script is functional and easy to understand. Do not include steps for installing Python or running the script. Thank you!
